Build a multi-tenant 3D photobooth display web app where users can create event collages with unique codes. 

Event attendees upload photos anonymously using just the code (no auth required), and photos appear in real-time in a customizable 3D environment built with React Three Fiber. 

Creators can customize the 3D scene (shapes, animations, colors, lighting, logos), moderate photos, and control how many of the 500 supported photos are displayed. 

Mix uploaded photos with stock photos from Unsplash. Include scene presets, multiple animation patterns (float, wave, spiral), and camera movements.

Tech: React + Vite, React Three Fiber, Supabase (auth/db/storage), React Router, Tailwind CSS.

Key routes: 
- / (landing)
- /join (enter code)
- /collage/:code (3D display + upload)
- /dashboard (manage collages - auth required)
- /collage/:code/moderation (auth required)
